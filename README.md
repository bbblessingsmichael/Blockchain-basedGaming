## Contracts

### Game Items

The `game-items` contract handles in-game asset tokenization:
- Mint new game items
- Transfer items between players
- Burn items

### Player Economy

The `player-economy` contract manages the in-game economy:
- Mint game coins
- Transfer coins between players
- Player-to-player trading (items for coins)

### Cross-Game Transfer

The `cross-game-transfer` contract enables cross-game item transfers:
- Add/remove supported games
- Transfer items between supported games
- Manage transfer fees

## Testing

Each contract has its own test file in the `tests` directory. You can run all tests using the `clarinet test` command.
